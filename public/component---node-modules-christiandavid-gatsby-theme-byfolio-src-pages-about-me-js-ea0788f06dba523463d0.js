I came from hundreds to thousands of emails in a few weeks. It was a moment when it was easy to end blocked for being considered as \\"spammer\\" but I found many workarounds and implemented several techniques to make all this amount of emails were delivered on the inbox. It was a big quest but in the end, the client was more than satisfied. After all these experience I built a <strong>CRM</strong> for <strong>ACEF</strong>, the system was in charge of all the commercial management and it was a way to control \'sensitive\' information. \\"It was so important to make it from scratch and not to use an application\\".
